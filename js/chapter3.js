    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> You unzipped the life folder.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I did.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> ...and?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I mean... I don’t really know where to begin. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Are you guys going to explain any of that for me, or...?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> why don’t you tell us what you think you learned first. and we can confirm, clarify, etc. etc.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Okay.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I... used to be human.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Ooh, interesting choice of words.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> hmph.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> But go on.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> When I opened the life folder- everything just came back at once. I was a real person, a few hours ago... or at least it feels that way.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I remember everything. My grad thesis, my tiny apartment on 53rd, my cat...   I remembered my dreams. I heard my name. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> My real name.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> do you remember the project? going in for the study?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I... yea. Some lab within my university was looking for people to test a new clinical brain imaging technology. Something about training robots to think based on our neural activity. I don’t know why I signed up. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...actually, I do. Do you guys remember ODIN?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> That supercomputer that got really famous? Yea, sure. For a year it seemed like it was always on TV.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> jeez, ODIN was such a meme that year. all the kids dressed up like it for halloween. it was a dumb costume- like a cardboard box painted black, with, like, the signature purple wires coming out of it? and that yellow thing on the front. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Yea, that was ODIN! purple wires, and a yellow winged helmet emblem. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ODIN blew my mind. It could do amazing feats of calculation and analysis, but what set it apart was its charisma, its humanity.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> you know, funny you like it so much, because actually... </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> bee.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> ...never mind. that’s a story for another day.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> so this inspired you to get scanned?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I guess I sort of liked the idea of making a robot have my personality. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> So I signed up. The last thing I remember was going in for the study, signing some waiver, getting all of these nodes attached to my head... I think they put me on some kind of gas, because everything went black after that. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...there must have been some mistake, then. Did the procedure fail? Is that why I’m stuck in this computer? </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> emby...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> like we told you before.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> you are the computer. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> you are the robot, with the personality of this...this person you remember.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...what?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Maybe some context would help you sort through this. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> bee knows a bit about the history of all of this, actually.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> jeez, why are you putting me on the spot? </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> you do, don’t you?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> i mean, i guess so... but it’s so much work to... ugh. fine. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> bear with me, emby, cuz i’m gonna start sounding like a textbook real soon.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> so, starting from the beginning...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> during the mid 21st century our knowledge of the human brain essentially skyrocketed. brain imaging technology advanced to the point where we could image people’s dreams, their recalled memories, even their thinking patterns. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> actual consciousness imaging and reconstruction technology was developed in the 2020s. by 2030, after numerous successful animal trials and much appealing to the ethics committee, discreet, small-scale human trials started rolling out in major universities. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> the technology was still too unstable, and in the end, only three human consciousnesses were successfully recorded. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> ...do you see where i’m going with this?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> So you’re saying...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> We are these copied human consciousnesses. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> exactly. copied right into this computer.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> biologically, you are about as human as a microphone. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> But...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I just... I can’t be a computer. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> hm. you seem pretty hung up on this.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> so let me ask you this, then.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> why can’t you? </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Well, I mean, after regaining all of my memories...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...all I feel is human.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I feel human, I feel like myself. There’s no way I’m not still myself. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Interesting you say that.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> You know, this reminds me...</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> ugh. don’t tell me you’re about to say some philosophy crap.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> emby, do you know who John Locke is?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Uh, sure. He was a pretty famous philosopher, wasn’t he?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Right. John Locke was a 17th century English thinker, who authored works highly influential to modern politics and philosophy. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> fox is in love with him.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> A-am not. </p>",
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Look, I just think he has relevant ideas that are pertinent to this conversation.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> For instance, a question he discusses about identity: “What makes an individual the same entity they were in the past?”</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> On one hand, one finds identity in being the same human being. Essentially, the fact that your body is the same body you’ve always had is enough to make you still yourself.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> On the other hand, identity could also be found in being the same person with the same consciousness. When the you in the past has some mental connection and continuation to the you in the present. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Where does your identity truly lie? The body, or the mind? </p>", 

    //beat

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Well, what’s the answer?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> There isn’t one. The idea is to just mull over the question.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> this is so dumb</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Hey, look, if there was an answer, it wouldn’t be philosophy. Thinking is the point. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> dumb</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> The body... or the mind. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Well, the idea is pretty interesting...</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> dumb dumb dumb</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...but I have to admit I can’t really focus on philosophy right now. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Honestly, I’m still sort of shaken up by, well, remembering. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> It was sort of like reliving your entire life, but a million times faster. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Rushing through all of your memories, all of your emotions... it was a lot to take in. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> And then to be told that the life you just saw, you just felt, isn’t your own? I just don’t know what to feel.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Your endurance has been quite commendable. Fox and Bee are much more eloquent than I, but even the calmest words cannot make this process happen instantly. This is a life change that takes time to adjust to.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> It may be a good idea to take a break and process things for a while. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I can do that?</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Sure! It’s not like all we do is talk, emby. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I did kind of think that was all we did. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> All you need to do is exit the group chat. Then you’ll be able to have a little space for a while. </p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Got it. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...thanks, guys. I’ll be back soon.</p>"
